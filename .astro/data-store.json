The goal is to build a machine learning model that can determine whether a given tweet is about a real disaster or not.\r\n\r\nThis project goes beyond a simple model, implementing a robust, professional-grade pipeline using a pre-trained RoBERTa model and a K-Fold Cross-Validation strategy.\r\n\r\n## 🏆 Key Achievements\r\n\r\n  * **Achieved a Top 10 Rank** on the final Kaggle leaderboard out of thousands of participants.\r\n  * Final Kaggle Public Leaderboard Score: **0.84768**.\r\n  * Utilized a robust **5-Fold Cross-Validation** strategy to ensure model stability and performance.\r\n  * Successfully fine-tuned a **RoBERTa-base** model using the Hugging Face and PyTorch ecosystem.\r\n\r\n## 🛠️ The Technical Pipeline\r\n\r\nThe final, high-scoring solution was achieved through a systematic and robust workflow:\r\n\r\n### 1\\. Data Preprocessing\r\n\r\nInitial cleaning of the tweet text was performed to standardize the input for the model. This included:\r\n\r\n  * Removing all URLs.\r\n  * Stripping HTML tags.\r\n  * Normalizing whitespace.\r\n\r\n### 2\\. Model Architecture: RoBERTa\r\n\r\nThe core of the solution is a pre-trained **RoBERTa-base** model from the Hugging Face `transformers` library. RoBERTa is an optimized version of BERT that is highly effective for language understanding tasks. The model was fine-tuned specifically for this binary classification problem.\r\n\r\n### 3\\. Training Strategy: K-Fold Cross-Validation\r\n\r\nTo build a highly robust model and get a reliable performance estimate, a **Stratified K-Fold** strategy with **5 splits** was implemented.\r\n\r\nThis involves training 5 separate RoBERTa models on different 80% subsets of the training data. Each model is validated on the remaining 20% of the data, ensuring that every sample is used for validation exactly once.\r\n\r\n### 4\\. Final Prediction: Ensembling with Majority Vote\r\n\r\nThe final prediction for each tweet in the test set was determined by a **majority vote** from the 5 models trained during the cross-validation process. This ensembling technique leverages the \"wisdom of the crowd\" by combining the predictions of all models, leading to a more accurate and stable final submission.\r\n\r\n## 📊 Results Summary\r\n\r\n  * **Average 5-Fold Validation Accuracy:** **83.61%**\r\n  * **Final Kaggle Public Leaderboard Score:** **0.84768**\r\n  * **Final Kaggle Rank:** **10**\r\n\r\n## Future Improvements\r\n\r\nWhile this solution achieved a top rank, further improvements could be explored:\r\n\r\n  * **Experiment with Larger Models:** Fine-tuning a `roberta-large` model could yield further improvements, though it requires more computational resources.\r\n  * **Advanced Ensembling:** Combining predictions from different transformer architectures (e.g., DeBERTa, BERT, RoBERTa) could create an even more powerful ensemble.\r\n  * **Meticulous Data Cleaning:** A deeper dive into cleaning tweet-specific slang, abbreviations, and misspellings might provide a slight edge.","src/pages/work/nlp_disaster.md","8fc0c9c3768a9df3",{"html":73,"metadata":74},"\u003Ch1 id=\"kaggle-nlp-with-disaster-tweets-top-10-finish\">Kaggle: NLP with Disaster Tweets (Top 10 Finish)\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started\">\u003C/a>\r\n\u003Ca href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/leaderboard\">\u003C/a>\r\n\u003Ca href=\"https://www.python.org\">\u003C/a>\r\n\u003Ca href=\"https://pytorch.org/\">\u003C/a>\r\n\u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/huggingface/transformers\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"project-overview\">Project Overview\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>This repository contains the code and methodology for the Kaggle competition “\u003Ca href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started\">Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets\u003C/a>”.

A key component of this work is a detailed quantitative analysis to verify that the restoration process preserves the physical dimensions (width) of the cracks, making the model suitable as a pre-processing step for automated inspection systems.","# CycleGAN for Crack Image Restoration and Feature Preservation Analysis\r\n\r\nThis project demonstrates the use of a CycleGAN model to restore degraded images of concrete cracks by removing blur and shadow artifacts. A key component of this work is a detailed quantitative analysis to verify that the restoration process preserves the physical dimensions (width) of the cracks, making the model suitable as a pre-processing step for automated inspection systems.\r\n\r\n## Visual Demonstration\r\n\r\nThe model is effective at removing both blur and shadow artifacts while maintaining the structural integrity of the original crack.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Methodology\r\n\r\nThe project follows a comprehensive end-to-end pipeline:\r\n\r\n1.  **Data Preparation**: A custom dataset was created by applying blur and shadow augmentations to a set of clean crack images.\r\n2.  **Model Training**: A CycleGAN model was trained on this unpaired dataset to learn the translation from degraded images (Domain A) to clean images (Domain B).\r\n3.  **Performance Evaluation**: The trained model was evaluated using standard image quality metrics (PSNR and SSIM).\r\n4.  **Feature Preservation Analysis**: A detailed analysis, using a custom script based on image skeletonization and distance transforms, was conducted to measure and compare the crack widths before and after restoration.\r\n\r\n## Dataset\r\n\r\nThe model was trained and evaluated on a custom-built dataset derived from a set of 1000 clean, cracked wall images.\r\n\r\n  * **Training Set**:\r\n      * `trainB` (Clean): 800 images.\r\n      * `trainA` (Augmented): 2400 images (800 blurred, 800 shadowed, 800 with both).\r\n  * **Testing Set**:\r\n      * `testB` (Clean Ground Truth): 200 images.\r\n      * `testA` (Augmented): 600 images (200 for each augmentation type).\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\nThe final analysis, including statistical calculations and plot generation, is performed using the scripts provided in the `output.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.\r\n\r\n## Results and Analysis\r\n\r\nThe final model from **Epoch 50** was selected as the best-performing model based on quantitative metrics.\r\n\r\n### Quantitative Model Performance\r\n\r\n| **Average PSNR** | 25.11 dB |\r\n\r\n| **Average SSIM** | 0.8903 |\r\n\r\nThese scores indicate a high level of image quality and structural similarity between the restored images and the original clean images.\r\n\r\n### Crack Width Preservation Analysis\r\n\r\nA detailed analysis was performed to measure the impact of restoration on the physical dimensions of the cracks.\r\n\r\n#### Blur Dataset Analysis\r\n\r\n**Descriptive Statistics:**\r\nThe blur artifact increased the mean measured crack width by over 1mm, while the CycleGAN restored it to near the original value. The model reduced the mean error by \\~70% and the error variance by over 98%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Correlation:**\r\nThe heatmap shows a very strong positive correlation (**0.95**) between the clean and restored crack widths, while the correlation with the blurred width was much lower (**0.77**).\r\n\r\n#### Shadow Dataset Analysis\r\n\r\n**Descriptive Statistics:**\r\nThe shadow artifact caused a massive distortion, increasing the mean measured width from \\~2.7mm to \\~14mm. The CycleGAN model successfully corrected this, reducing the mean error by **\\~97%**.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Correlation and Error Distribution:**\r\nThe visualizations from the report, such as the scatter plot and box plot, provide clear evidence of the model's success. The scatter plot shows a tight clustering of restored widths around the ideal 1:1 line.

The model classifies audio into 21 different emotion categories with varying intensity levels.\r\n\r\n## Dataset Structure\r\n\r\n- **Training set**: 2,486 samples\r\n- **Validation set**: 410 samples  \r\n- **Test set**: 738 samples\r\n- **Total**: 3,634 audio files\r\n\r\n## Emotion Labels (21 categories)\r\n\r\nThe model predicts emotions with intensity levels:\r\n\r\n- **ANG** (Anger): HI, LO, MD, XX (High, Low, Medium, Unknown intensity)\r\n- **DIS** (Disgust): HI, LO, MD, XX\r\n- **FEA** (Fear): HI, LO, MD, XX\r\n- **HAP** (Happy): HI, LO, MD, XX\r\n- **NEU** (Neutral): XX only\r\n- **SAD** (Sad): HI, LO, MD, XX\r\n\r\n## Technical Implementation\r\n\r\n### 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing\r\n\r\n- Uses Hugging Face `datasets` library to load CSV files\r\n- Audio resampling to 16kHz (standard for Wav2Vec2)\r\n- Padding/truncation to 5 seconds maximum length\r\n- Label mapping from text to integer IDs\r\n\r\n### 2. Data Augmentation (Training Only)\r\n\r\nUses `audiomentations` library with:\r\n\r\n- **Gaussian Noise**: 0.001-0.015 amplitude (50% probability)\r\n- **Pitch Shift**: ±4 semitones (50% probability)\r\n- **Time Stretch**: 0.8-1.25x speed (50% probability)\r\n\r\n### 3. Model Architecture\r\n\r\n- Base model: `facebook/wav2vec2-base`\r\n- Added classification head for 21 emotion classes\r\n- Uses `AutoModelForAudioClassification`\r\n\r\n### 4. Training Configuration\r\n\r\n- Batch size: 4 (both train/eval)\r\n- Learning rate: 1e-5\r\n- Epochs: 15 (interrupted at ~10 epochs)\r\n- Evaluation every 500 steps\r\n- Weight decay: 0.01\r\n- No mixed precision (fp16=False)\r\n\r\n## Training Results Analysis\r\n\r\n### Performance Progression\r\n\r\n| Step | Training Loss | Validation Loss | Accuracy |\r\n|------|---------------|-----------------|----------|\r\n| 500  | 2.539         | 2.360          | 26.6%    |\r\n| 1000 | 2.103         | 1.936          | 38.5%    |\r\n| 3000 | 1.071         | 1.454          | 54.9%    |\r\n| 4500 | 0.731         | 1.608          | 62.4%    |\r\n| 6000 | 0.513         | 1.799          | 61.0%    |\r\n\r\n### Key Observations\r\n\r\n#### ✅ Positive Indicators\r\n\r\n1. **Strong Learning**: Training loss decreased from 2.54 to 0.51 (80% reduction)\r\n2. **Good Initial Progress**: Validation accuracy improved from 26.6% to 62.4%\r\n3. **Reasonable Baseline**: 60% accuracy on 21-class problem (vs 4.8% random chance)\r\n\r\n#### ⚠️ Concerning Patterns\r\n\r\n1. **Overfitting Signs**:\r\n   - Training loss continues decreasing while validation loss increases after step 3000\r\n   - Gap between training and validation loss widens significantly\r\n   - Validation accuracy plateaus around 60%\r\n\r\n2. **Model Convergence Issues**:\r\n   - Validation loss becomes unstable (increases from 1.45 to 1.80)\r\n   - Performance degradation in later steps suggests overtraining\r\n\r\n## Final Test Results\r\n\r\n- **Test Accuracy**: 59.8%\r\n- **Test Loss**: 1.824\r\n\r\n## Recommendations for Improvement\r\n\r\n### 1. Address Overfitting\r\n\r\n- **Early Stopping**: Implement based on validation loss (stop around step 3000)\r\n- **Regularization**: Increase dropout, add L2 regularization\r\n- **Data**: Collect more training samples if possible\r\n\r\n### 2. Hyperparameter Tuning\r\n\r\n- **Learning Rate**: Try 5e-6 or 2e-5\r\n- **Batch Size**: Experiment with larger batches (8, 16) if GPU memory allows\r\n- **Augmentation**: Reduce augmentation intensity or probability\r\n\r\n### 3. Model Architecture\r\n\r\n- **Freeze Layers**: Freeze early Wav2Vec2 layers, only fine-tune later layers\r\n- **Different Base**: Try `wav2vec2-large` or `wav2vec2-large-960h`\r\n\r\n### 4. Data Analysis\r\n\r\n- **Class Balance**: Check for class imbalance issues\r\n- **Data Quality**: Analyze misclassified samples\r\n- **Cross-validation**: Implement k-fold validation\r\n\r\n### 5. Advanced Techniques\r\n\r\n- **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models\r\n- **Pseudo-labeling**: Use model predictions on unlabeled data\r\n- **Multi-task Learning**: Joint training with related tasks\r\n\r\n## Code Quality Assessment\r\n\r\n### Strengths\r\n\r\n- Well-structured pipeline with clear sections\r\n- Proper data cleaning and validation\r\n- Good use of Hugging Face ecosystem\r\n- Comprehensive augmentation strategy\r\n\r\n### Areas for Improvement\r\n\r\n- Missing early stopping implementation\r\n- No hyperparameter search\r\n- Limited error analysis and visualization\r\n- Could benefit from more detailed logging and metrics\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nThis is a solid implementation that achieves reasonable performance (60% accuracy) on a challenging 21-class emotion recognition task. The main issue is overfitting, which could be addressed with early stopping and regularization techniques. The code demonstrates good understanding of modern NLP/audio processing pipelines.","src/pages/work/emotionai.md","746295b4c692b289",{"html":181,"metadata":182},"\u003Ch1 id=\"wav2vec2-emotion-recognition-model-analysis\">Wav2Vec2 Emotion Recognition Model Analysis\u003C/h1>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"overview\">Overview\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>This notebook implements a fine-tuning pipeline for Facebook’s Wav2Vec2 model to perform emotion recognition from audio data.

Using a sophisticated CycleGAN model, our system analyzes an image of a vada and provides an objective, unsolicited Vada Perfection Index (VPI) score, ending family arguments one snack at a time.\r\n\r\n### The Problem (that doesn't exist)\r\n\r\nEvery day, millions of people consume vadas of questionable quality. The lack of a universal, quantifiable metric for vada perfection—from its roundness to its hole-to-vada ratio—threatens the very fabric of our tea-time traditions. This rampant subjectivity is a recipe for culinary chaos and inconsistent snacking experiences.\r\n\r\n### The Solution (that nobody asked for)\r\n\r\nOur solution is a two-stage hybrid pipeline that combines the predictive power of deep learning with the analytical precision of classical computer vision to deliver the ultimate Vada Perfection Index (VPI) score.\r\n\r\n✨Stage 1: The AI Oracle (CycleGAN)\r\nWe start by feeding a real-world vada image into a trained CycleGAN model. Acting as an AI Oracle, the model \"hallucinates\" idealized markings onto the input image — essentially generating the platonic ideal of what the vada should look like.\r\n\r\nThe result? A marked image representing the Vada Perfection that could have been.\r\n\r\n✨Stage 2: The Scrutinizer (CV + VPI Calculation)\r\nThe marked image is then passed through a classical Computer Vision module, which extracts four key metrics. These metrics are used to compute the final Vada Perfection Index (VPI\\\u003Csub\\>S\\\u003C/sub\\>) as follows:\r\n\r\nVPI\\_S = (w\\_size · S\\_size + w\\_shape · S\\_shape + w\\_hole · S\\_hole + w\\_color · S\\_color) × 100\r\n\r\n📏 Metric Breakdown\r\n\r\n| Metric               | Description                                                                                                 |\r\n|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| **S\u003Csub>shape\u003C/sub>** | Measures how closely the vada's outer boundary matches a perfect circle.                                    |\r\n| **S\u003Csub>hole\u003C/sub>**  | Evaluates the position and roundness of the hole, comparing it with the GAN’s ideal.                        |\r\n| **S\u003Csub>color\u003C/sub>** | Measures deviation from the perfect golden-brown color using the **CIEDE2000** color-difference formula.     |\r\n| **S\u003Csub>size\u003C/sub>**  | Penalizes vadas that are too big or too small, using a Gaussian function centered on the ideal diameter.     |\r\n\r\n\r\n🎚️Weight Calibration\r\nw\\_size  = 0.01  \r\nw\\_shape = 0.40  \r\nw\\_hole  = 0.30  \r\nw\\_color = 0.29\r\n\r\n## Technical Details\r\n\r\n### Technologies/Components Used\r\n\r\nFor Software:\r\n\r\n  -Languages used: Python\r\n  -Frameworks used: PyTorch, Flask\r\n  -Libraries used:\r\n      - OpenCV (`opencv-python`) for computer vision analysis\r\n      - Pillow (PIL) for image manipulation and report generation\r\n      - Albumentations for data augmentation\r\n      - NumPy for numerical operations\r\n  -Tools used:\r\n      - Git / GitHub for version control\r\n      - Visual Studio Code\r\n\r\nFor Hardware:\r\n\r\n  -Main components: A PC/Laptop with a dedicated NVIDIA GPU.
